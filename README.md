# data-analysis-geographic-data
This topic came into picture when dealing with airbnb data set where geo locations(latitude, longitude) were also included in the raw data.

This also brought my mind into the days when I had to map satellight images into a geographic information system (GIS), I can still recall lots of computation needed where you need to take into consideration the angel from which the image was captured from the satellight and different kind of interpolations needed to adjust the image.

Anyway come back to the topic, I did some research and decided to try out below two methods:
 * Geographic data with [basemap](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/04.13-geographic-data-with-basemap.html) 
 * Goolge [map static api](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/maps-static/intro)
